## Hi, I am Daniel! 👋

I am glad you found your way to my profile.

### About me

- 💻 Computer Science Student
- 🛠️ Mechanical Engineer
- 💡 Passionate Developer
- 🚀 Skydiving Instructor
- 🐳 Freediver

I found myself in the vast world of coding just recently.
Due to the pandemic, i got bored out of my mind, nothing to do... so I tried to challenge myself and learn to code.

**I had no idea what lies ahead of me.**

My background in mechanical engineering made me want to checkout programming micro controllers, so i got into **C** and **C++**.

It didn´t take long till i found myself trying to develop websites. HTML, CSS, and the best stuff... **JavaScript**. So much cool things to learn, the awesome community, the amazing projects people build together.... 
I even ended up signing up to uni doing my Computer Science Degree.

**I am hooked!**
 
### I am currently working on

* A React app for documenting and managing staff schedules better
* An electron desktop app to manage boarding and time schedules for a skydiving dropzone

### I am currently learning

* More Vanilla Node.js to see behind the scenes of Express
* More Javascript. Cause there is always something to learn
* A deeper understanding of React
* 
### Goals

* Getting to know more people in the community
* Becoming more active in the open source community
* Land a job in software engineering
